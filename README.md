# BUS462
## Deliverable
The project is to analyse Formula 1 data through building OLS and LOGIT models with R language. <br/>
Scenario: Our team is hired as consultant for Renault to provide analysis on what constructor position they can achieve in 2022

In this project,  we <br/>
-> find out the predictors of lap time performance<br/>
-> predict the position based on the the above lap time data

Decision making: <br/>
Drivers with constructors -> is getting a new driver going to decrease lap times? <br/>
How well are Renault drivers perform next year?

## Instructions
Upload your files on under the main branch
## To upload your code
```C++
//click the add button and choose file to upload
```
If you have not finished your code and would like to upload your file on github, you can create your own branch and upload your files there first
## To create a new branch
```C++
//tab "code" -> "main" -> expand the main list -> type your branch name (eg. "chloe") -> click create branch under main
```
## To upload your code under your branch
```C++
//tab "code" -> "main" -> expand the main list -> switch to your desired branch -> click the add button and choose file to upload  
```
