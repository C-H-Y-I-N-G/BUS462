# BUS462
## Deliverable
The project is to analyse Formula 1 data through building OLS and LOGIT models with R language. 

Scenario: Our team is hired as consultant for Renault to provide analysis on what constructor position they can achieve in 2022

In this project,  we 

-> find out the predictors of lap time performance

-> predict the position based on the the above lap time data

Decision making: 

Drivers with constructors -> is getting a new driver going to decrease lap times?

How well are Renault drivers perform next year?

## Instructions
upload your files on under the main branch
## to uploead your code
```C++
//click the add button and choose file to upload
```
if you have not finish your code and would like to upload your file on github, you can create your own branch and upload your files there first
## to create a new branch
```C++
//tab "code" -> "main" -> expand the main list -> type your branch name (eg. "chloe") -> click create branch under main
```
## to uploead your code under your branch
```C++
//tab "code" -> "main" -> expand the main list -> switch to your desired branch -> click the add button and choose file to upload  
```
if you have any questions just ask in messenger
